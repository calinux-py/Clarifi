Clarifi is a Chrome extension that summarizes selected text using ChatGPT. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data:

**1. Data We Collect**  
- **API Key:** Your OpenAI API key is stored using Chrome's sync storage and is masked in the interface.  
- **Selected Text & Summaries:** The text you select and its generated summary are stored (up to your four most recent entries) in Chrome sync storage.  
- **User Preferences:** Settings like dark mode are stored locally for your convenience.

**2. How We Use Your Data**  
- Your API key is used solely to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.  
- Selected text and summaries are processed to provide the summarization service.  
- All data is stored locally via Chrome's sync storage and is not shared with third parties, except that your text is sent to OpenAI to generate summaries.
